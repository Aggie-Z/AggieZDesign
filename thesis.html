			<h1>College Thesis</h1>

			<p>In my final year of graphic design, I was tasked with coming up with a thesis topic where I would be creating a product in the end. As someone who is incredibly passionate about books, I decided a subscription box would be a fantastic start!</p>

			<p>I’ve worked for Indigo for several years now, and obviously am a huge fan of reading. One of the things I noticed was the lack of exclusive content featured in the company. Having a huge interest in book subscription boxes I decided it was high time to make one myself!</p>

			<p>Over the course of my final year I will be creating a subscription box for the company, as well as exclusive and unique content featured in every month’s box that will build up the hype and excitement for Indigo’s subscription service even more.</p>
